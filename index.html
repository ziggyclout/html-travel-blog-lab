    <p>What a place to visit.It is really breathtaking as one can experience the sunrise in the morning and the sunset in the evening.
        There are really cool things to do such as ;swimming,interacting,fooding,learning,mountain climbing and among others.
        Being out there was like being in the wild since there were different animals and different species.
        I would highly recommend any one looking for an adventure to access the recordings.
        Come and see what adventure holds on the Fire Island.
